# Jquery-calculator
Create a new html page for this jQuery version of the Calculator. Use jquery to make numbers appear in the top box as you click the number buttons. -	This should work like a regular calculator: If you click two number buttons in a row, the numbers will append. If you click an arithmetic button, the view will zero out so you can start entering numbers from scratch again.
